# Project Progress

## What Works
- Main page scraping
  - Performance titles
  - Venues
  - Dates
  - Thumbnails
- Individual page scraping
  - Descriptions
  - Video links
- MongoDB storage
- Scheduled updates

## Known Issues
- Description scraping sometimes fails
- No video links found for 2025-26 season
- Some selectors require multiple attempts
- Context window errors when debugging complex frontend issues with large datasets

## Current Status
- Core functionality complete
- Successfully storing performance data
- Regular updates configured
- Error handling in place
- Frontend description display issue fixed:
  - Descriptions now display properly without truncation
  - No more "Read More" buttons
  - Added fallback text for missing descriptions
  - Added visual styling to make descriptions stand out
- Removed "Load More" button to show all performances at once
- Updated API port configuration to match running server (8000)
- Advanced testing strategies implemented
- Frontend thumbnail rendering issue fixed:
  - Added proper URL validation for image sources
  - Implemented fallback to placeholder image for invalid URLs
  - Added error handling for image loading failures
  - Created thumbnail-verification.js for testing the fix
- Company logo display issue for Paris Opera Ballet fixed:
  - Created a script to scrape the official logo from the Paris Opera Ballet website
  - Downloaded the logo directly from the source: https://www.operadeparis.fr/images/universe_opera/logos/universe_logo_pop.png
  - Saved the logo to the correct location in the resources directory
  - Modified the CSS to preserve the original logo colors by:
    - Removing the white circular background container
    - Removing border-radius, padding, and box-shadow
    - Adding explicit styling to ensure the logo displays at its natural size and colors
    - Setting filter: none to prevent color alterations
  - Updated the HTML to ensure proper sizing of the logo
  - Verified that the changes display the logo with its original colors

- Paris Opera Ballet logo flickering on GitHub Pages fixed:
  - Added a preload link for the logo image in the HTML head
  - Removed CSS animations that were causing flickering
  - Disabled the loading state CSS that was causing visual glitches
  - Added proper image loading event handlers in JavaScript
  - Implemented a forced reload with timeout to ensure proper loading
  - Added explicit opacity and visibility styles to the logo image

- Client-side data persistence implemented:
  - Added localStorage caching for API data to ensure persistence between visits
  - Implemented cache versioning system to handle data structure changes
  - Added cache expiration mechanism (30-day default)
  - Created Shift+Ctrl+R keyboard shortcut for manual data refresh
  - Added visual indicator for refresh operations
  - Modified all data fetching functions to check cache before API requests
  - Ensured GitHub Pages version can persist MongoDB data until explicitly refreshed

- Mobile display issues fixed:
  - Resolved issue where only one performance was visible on mobile devices
  - Added explicit overflow handling for performance containers
  - Improved mobile-specific CSS with forced column layout and full width
  - Added a dedicated mobile refresh button for easy cache clearing
  - Ensured all performance items are properly displayed on small screens
  - Fixed stacking and layout issues in mobile view

## Next Development Phase
- Verify the thumbnail rendering fix is working correctly:
  - Use the verification.html page to run all verification scripts
  - Check the browser console for detailed verification results
  - Confirm that thumbnails are displaying properly
  - Ensure fallback images are used when needed
- Continue implementing context window optimization strategies for frontend debugging
  - Modular approach to file analysis
  - Focused debugging techniques
  - Memory-efficient implementation patterns
  - Surgical editing for targeted fixes
- API development
- Data validation improvements
- Additional error recovery mechanisms
- Performance optimization
- Consider image optimization for faster loading
