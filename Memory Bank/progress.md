# Project Progress

## What Works

### Core Infrastructure
- ✅ Project structure with modular architecture
- ✅ Common utilities for database operations and scraping
- ✅ Main entry point script (`run.py`) for running different components
- ✅ Comprehensive test infrastructure

### Scrapers
- ✅ Paris Opera Ballet scraper
- ✅ Bolshoi Ballet scraper
- ✅ Boston Ballet scraper
- ✅ Configurable scraping options (local file vs. web, Selenium support)
- ✅ Performance details extraction
- ✅ Fallback to default descriptions when needed

### API Server
- ✅ RESTful API with Flask
- ✅ Endpoints for accessing all performances
- ✅ Company-specific endpoints
- ✅ Search functionality across all companies
- ✅ Support for multiple ballet companies (Paris Opera, Bolshoi, Boston)
- ✅ CORS support for frontend integration
- ✅ Pagination support

### Frontend Architecture
- ✅ New frontend architecture with clean separation of concerns
- ✅ Data service layer for API communication with caching
- ✅ UI controllers for business logic and DOM manipulation
- ✅ Responsive CSS using modern layout techniques
- ✅ Mock data fallback for offline development
- ✅ Company page implementation with performance listings

### Testing
- ✅ Unit tests for Paris Opera Ballet scraper
- ✅ Unit tests for Bolshoi Ballet scraper
- ✅ Unit tests for Boston Ballet scraper
- ✅ Unit tests for API server
- ✅ Mock-based testing to avoid external dependencies
- ✅ MongoDB connection testing and diagnostics

## What's Left to Build

### Frontend Implementation
- ✅ Data service layer with caching and error handling
- ✅ Company page UI controller
- ✅ Company page HTML template and styles
- ⬜ Home page with featured performances
- ⬜ Performance details page
- ⬜ Search page with filtering options
- ⬜ Companies listing page
- ⬜ Implement unified search across all companies
- ⬜ Add filtering by date, venue, etc.

### Additional Ballet Companies
- ✅ Boston Ballet (USA)
- ⬜ Royal Ballet (UK)
- ⬜ New York City Ballet (USA)
- ⬜ Mariinsky Ballet (Russia)
- ⬜ American Ballet Theatre (USA)

### Performance Improvements
- ⬜ Implement server-side caching for frequently accessed data
- ✅ Implement client-side caching with localStorage
- ⬜ Optimize database queries
- ⬜ Add indexes to MongoDB collections

### Deployment
- ⬜ Set up CI/CD pipeline
- ⬜ Containerize the application with Docker
- ⬜ Create deployment scripts
- ⬜ Set up monitoring and logging

### Documentation
- ✅ Frontend architecture documentation
- ✅ MongoDB connection issue documentation
- ⬜ API documentation with Swagger/OpenAPI
- ⬜ Developer guide for adding new ballet companies
- ⬜ User guide for the web interface

## Current Status

The project has made significant progress with the implementation of scrapers for three major ballet companies (Paris Opera Ballet, Bolshoi Ballet, and Boston Ballet), a unified API server, and a new frontend architecture. The core infrastructure is in place, including a modular architecture, common utilities, and comprehensive test coverage.

The frontend architecture has been redesigned with a clean separation of concerns:
- A data service layer that handles API communication with caching and error handling
- UI controllers that separate business logic from DOM manipulation
- Responsive CSS using modern layout techniques
- Mock data fallback for offline development and testing

We've identified and documented a critical issue with MongoDB connectivity, which is preventing the database operations from working properly. Extensive testing has been conducted, and a comprehensive report with recommendations has been created.

The next phase will focus on:
1. Resolving the MongoDB connection issues
2. Completing the frontend implementation with additional pages
3. Adding scrapers for more ballet companies
4. Implementing performance improvements
5. Setting up deployment infrastructure

## Known Issues

1. **MongoDB Connectivity**: Persistent SSL/TLS handshake issues when connecting to MongoDB Atlas:
   - All connection attempts fail with "SSL handshake failed: [SSL: TLSV1_ALERT_INTERNAL_ERROR] tlsv1 alert internal error"
   - Root cause appears to be SSL/TLS version incompatibility with LibreSSL 2.8.3
   - Comprehensive testing and documentation in `mongodb_connection_final_report.md`
   - This is a critical blocker for database operations

2. **Data Consistency**: Some fields may be missing or inconsistent between different ballet companies
3. **Error Handling**: Need more robust error handling for edge cases in scraping
4. **Performance**: Large-scale scraping may be slow and resource-intensive
5. **Testing**: Need more integration tests for the full system
6. **Frontend**: Need to implement additional pages and features
