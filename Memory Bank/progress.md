# Project Progress

## What Works
- Main page scraping
  - Performance titles
  - Venues
  - Dates
  - Thumbnails
- Individual page scraping
  - Descriptions
  - Video links
- MongoDB storage
- Scheduled updates

## Known Issues
- Description scraping sometimes fails
- No video links found for 2025-26 season
- Some selectors require multiple attempts
- Frontend thumbnail rendering issue: thumbnails display as grey boxes with placeholder text despite valid thumbnail URLs in MongoDB
- Context window errors when debugging complex frontend issues with large datasets

## Current Status
- Core functionality complete
- Successfully storing performance data
- Regular updates configured
- Error handling in place
- Frontend description display issue fixed:
  - Descriptions now display properly without truncation
  - No more "Read More" buttons
  - Added fallback text for missing descriptions
  - Added visual styling to make descriptions stand out
- Removed "Load More" button to show all performances at once
- Updated API port configuration to match running server (8000)
- Advanced testing strategies implemented

## Next Development Phase
- Verify the description display fix is working correctly:
  - Use the verification.html page to run all verification scripts
  - Check the browser console for detailed verification results
  - Confirm that descriptions are displaying properly without truncation
  - Ensure all performances are visible without pagination
- Fix frontend thumbnail rendering issue (highest priority)
  - Apply the same surgical editing approach used for the description display fix
  - Use the advanced testing strategies to verify the fix
- Implement context window optimization strategies for frontend debugging
  - Modular approach to file analysis
  - Focused debugging techniques
  - Memory-efficient implementation patterns
  - Surgical editing for targeted fixes
- API development
- Data validation improvements
- Additional error recovery mechanisms
- Performance optimization
