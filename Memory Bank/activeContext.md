# Active Context

## Current Focus

The Ballet World project is currently focused on integrating multiple ballet company data sources into a unified platform. We have successfully implemented:

1. A restructured project with a modular architecture
2. Scrapers for Paris Opera Ballet, Bolshoi Ballet, and Boston Ballet
3. A unified API server to serve data from all three companies
4. Common utilities for database operations and scraping functions
5. Test infrastructure for all components
6. A new frontend architecture with clean separation of concerns

## Recent Changes

- Implemented a Boston Ballet scraper that extracts performance data from the Boston Ballet website
- Updated the API server to include Boston Ballet performances in all endpoints
- Updated the run.py script to support running the Boston Ballet scraper
- Added test infrastructure for the Boston Ballet scraper
- Reorganized the project structure to follow a more modular approach with separate directories for each ballet company scraper
- Created common utilities in `scrapers/common/` for shared functionality
- Implemented a Bolshoi Ballet scraper that can extract performance data from both local HTML files and the web
- Developed a unified API server that provides access to data from all ballet companies
- Added comprehensive test suites for all components
- Created a main entry point script (`run.py`) that can run individual components or the entire system
- Developed a new frontend architecture in `PageTests/WorldBallet-Apr27Release/` with:
  - A dedicated data service layer (`ballet-data-service.js`) that handles API communication with caching
  - UI controllers that separate business logic from DOM manipulation
  - Responsive CSS using modern layout techniques
  - Mock data fallback for offline development and testing
- Conducted extensive testing of MongoDB connection issues and documented findings in `mongodb_connection_final_report.md`

## Next Steps

1. **Database Connectivity**: Resolve the MongoDB connection issues by implementing the recommended solutions in the MongoDB connection report
2. **Frontend Integration**: Complete the integration of the new frontend architecture with the API
3. **Additional Ballet Companies**: Add scrapers for more ballet companies (Royal Ballet, New York City Ballet, Mariinsky Ballet, etc.)
4. **Performance Improvements**: Optimize database queries and implement caching for frequently accessed data
5. **Enhanced Search**: Implement more advanced search capabilities (filtering by date, venue, etc.)
6. **Deployment**: Set up CI/CD pipeline and deployment infrastructure
7. **Frontend Features**: Add additional pages (home page, search page, performance details page)

## Active Decisions and Considerations

- **Data Consistency**: We're ensuring consistent data structure across different ballet companies to facilitate unified API responses
- **Error Handling**: Implementing robust error handling in scrapers to deal with inconsistent website structures
- **Testing Strategy**: Using pytest with mocks to test scrapers and API without requiring actual web requests
- **Scalability**: Designing the system to easily accommodate additional ballet companies
- **Performance**: Using threading for parallel scraping to improve performance
- **Frontend Architecture**: Adopting a clean separation of concerns with:
  - Data layer: Handles API communication, caching, and data processing
  - UI layer: Manages DOM manipulation and event handling
  - View layer: HTML templates and CSS styles
- **Caching Strategy**: Implementing client-side caching with localStorage to reduce API calls and improve performance
- **Offline Support**: Providing mock data fallback when the API is unavailable
- **Database Connectivity**: Currently facing SSL/TLS handshake issues with MongoDB Atlas connection:
  - Identified persistent SSL handshake failures across multiple connection configurations
  - Root cause appears to be SSL/TLS version incompatibility with LibreSSL 2.8.3
  - Created comprehensive test scripts and documentation in `simple_mongo_test.py`, `file_mongo_test.py`, `test_direct_connection.py`, and `test_direct_connection_file.py`
  - Documented findings and recommendations in `mongodb_connection_diagnosis.md` and `mongodb_connection_final_report.md`
  - Prioritized solutions include updating OpenSSL/LibreSSL, trying alternative Python SSL implementations, and checking MongoDB Atlas network access settings
