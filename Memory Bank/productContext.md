# Product Context

## Project Purpose

Ballet World is a comprehensive platform designed to serve ballet enthusiasts by aggregating performance information from major ballet companies around the world. The project aims to solve several key problems:

1. **Information Fragmentation**: Ballet performance information is scattered across different company websites, making it difficult for enthusiasts to discover performances.

2. **Inconsistent Data**: Different ballet companies present their performance information in different formats and with varying levels of detail.

3. **Discovery Challenges**: Ballet enthusiasts often need to visit multiple websites to discover performances they might be interested in.

4. **Limited Search Capabilities**: Individual ballet company websites often have limited search and filtering capabilities.

## Target Audience

The platform is designed for:

- **Ballet Enthusiasts**: People who regularly attend ballet performances and want to stay informed about upcoming shows.
- **Cultural Tourists**: Travelers who want to include ballet performances in their itineraries.
- **Dance Students and Professionals**: People in the dance community who want to study different companies' repertoires.
- **Arts Organizations**: Organizations that need to track ballet performances for research or programming purposes.

## User Experience Goals

### For End Users

1. **Unified Experience**: Provide a single platform where users can discover ballet performances from multiple companies.
2. **Rich Information**: Offer detailed information about each performance, including descriptions, dates, venues, and media.
3. **Powerful Search**: Enable users to search across all companies by title, composer, date, venue, etc.
4. **Personalization**: Allow users to save favorites and receive notifications about upcoming performances.
5. **Mobile-Friendly**: Ensure the platform works well on mobile devices for on-the-go access.

### For Developers

1. **Extensibility**: Make it easy to add new ballet companies to the platform.
2. **API Access**: Provide a well-documented API for third-party applications.
3. **Maintainability**: Ensure the codebase is well-structured and easy to maintain.
4. **Robustness**: Build scrapers that can handle changes in the source websites.

## Key Features

2. **Unified API**: RESTful API that provides access to performance data from all companies.
3. **Search Functionality**: Ability to search across all companies by title, description, etc.

3. **User Accounts**: User registration, login, and personalization features.
4. **Notifications**: Email or push notifications for upcoming performances.
5. **Mobile App**: Native mobile applications for iOS and Android.

## Success Metrics

The success of the Ballet World platform will be measured by:

1. **User Engagement**: Number of active users, session duration, and return rate.
2. **Data Coverage**: Number of ballet companies and performances covered.
3. **Data Accuracy**: Percentage of performance information that is accurate and up-to-date.
4. **Search Effectiveness**: Percentage of searches that lead to user engagement with performance details.
5. **API Usage**: Number of API requests and third-party integrations.

## Competitive Landscape

While there are some existing platforms that aggregate cultural events, none specifically focus on ballet performances with the depth and breadth that Ballet World aims to provide:

1. **General Event Platforms**: Sites like Eventbrite and Ticketmaster list some ballet performances but lack specialized features and comprehensive coverage.
2. **Cultural Aggregators**: Platforms like Culture Trip include ballet in their broader cultural coverage but don't provide detailed performance information.
3. **Individual Company Websites**: Each ballet company has its own website, but these don't provide cross-company discovery.
