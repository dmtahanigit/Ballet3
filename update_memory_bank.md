# Memory Bank Update: Bolshoi Ballet Integration

## Summary of Changes

I've successfully integrated the Bolshoi Ballet data into the World Ballet project, using the same MongoDB database but with separate collections for each ballet company. This approach maintains a unified data architecture while keeping the data for each company separate.

### Key Components Implemented:

1. **API Server Enhancement**:
   - Updated the API server to support multiple ballet companies
   - Added new endpoints for Bolshoi Ballet data
   - Created a transformation function for Bolshoi performance data
   - Added combined endpoints to retrieve data from all companies

2. **Bolshoi Logo Creation**:
   - Created an SVG logo for the Bolshoi Theatre
   - Added HTML page for logo generation and download
   - Ensured logo follows the same style as the Paris Opera Ballet logo

3. **Data Structure**:
   - Maintained consistent data structure between companies
   - Added company-specific fields to differentiate data sources
   - Ensured proper date parsing for different date formats

## Technical Details

### Database Structure
- Database: `ballet3`
- Collections:
  - `paris_opera_ballet`: Paris Opera Ballet performances
  - `bolshoi_ballet`: Bolshoi Ballet performances

### API Endpoints
- `/api/companies`: List all ballet companies
- `/api/companies/paris-opera-ballet`: Paris Opera Ballet company info
- `/api/companies/paris-opera-ballet/performances`: Paris Opera Ballet performances
- `/api/companies/bolshoi-ballet`: Bolshoi Ballet company info
- `/api/companies/bolshoi-ballet/performances`: Bolshoi Ballet performances
- `/api/companies/all/performances`: Combined performances from all companies

### Data Transformation
- Created specialized transformation functions for each company's data format
- Standardized date formats across all performances
- Added default descriptions for well-known ballets
- Ensured consistent field naming for frontend compatibility

## Next Steps

1. **Frontend Integration**:
   - Create a new page for Bolshoi Ballet following the same UI pattern as Paris Opera Ballet
   - Update the navigation to include the new company
   - Implement company switching functionality

2. **Data Enrichment**:
   - Scrape additional performance details from the Bolshoi website
   - Add more images and media content
   - Enhance performance descriptions

3. **Testing**:
   - Verify API responses with the frontend
   - Test pagination and filtering
   - Ensure proper error handling

This integration sets up a scalable architecture for adding more ballet companies in the future while maintaining a consistent user experience.
